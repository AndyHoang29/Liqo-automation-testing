About the repository, You should already have:
 - An AWS account (which is already attached to your environemnt terminal)
 - Terraform installed in your env

The code is only working with creating EKS because the automation with Helm has errors and for now we can only deploy Helm manually. 
If you wanna see those errors, you can unbind all the comments by using the combination of Ctrl + "/".
